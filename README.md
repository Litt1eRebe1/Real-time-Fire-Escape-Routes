The Real-time Fire Escape Routes (Real-time FER) System is a new approach to solve an age-old problem. The main goal of the Real-time FER is to indicate to the agent using the application what the most efficient route in a specific building one should take in the case of a fire emergency. Each agent in the building will be sent a push notification to his/her phone indicating what escape path to follow in such extreme situation.
